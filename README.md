# University-Grade-Management

An application to maintain student exam details for a university. The project has four priority levels of users, Administrator, Professors, Administrative Staff and Students.  Administrator has the highest privileges and has access to all functionalities.
Here I have used a text file to add the exam details of the students. Data is manipulated and stored in the text file.
